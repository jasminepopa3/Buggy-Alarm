⏰ **Epic story:** 
We aim to create a mobile application that functions as an alarm clock but with a twist for programming enthusiasts. Users will have to solve programming challenges to turn off the alarm, testing their skills in various programming languages.

🖥️ **Tech Stack:** 
Android Studio IDE (Java) + Firebase (Database)

📋 **User Stories:**

✅ 1. As a user of the application, I want to be able to set an alarm for a specific time and date.      
✅ 2. As a user of the application, I want to be able to set a recurring alarm (daily/weekly/monthly, etc.).     
✅ 3. As a user of the application, I want to set a specific number of bugs to solve to turn off the alarm.     
✅ 4. As a user of the application, I want to be able to choose the alarm tone from a list.    
✅ 5. As a user of the application, I want to be able to choose the programming language in which bugs will be generated.     
✅ 6. As a programmer, I want to train my reaction speed and observation skills by solving bugs even when I'm just waking up.     
✅ 7. As an IT enthusiast, I want to periodically practice my programming knowledge.     
✅ 8. As a user of the application, I want to choose the difficulty level of the bugs.     
✅ 9. As an aspiring IT professional, I want to see the solving time for each bug in an alarm.      
✅ 10. As an aspiring IT professional, I want to see the average solving time for bugs in an alarm.
