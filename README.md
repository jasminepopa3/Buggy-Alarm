⏰ **Project Idea:** 
We aim to create a mobile application that functions as an alarm clock but with a twist for programming enthusiasts. Users will have to solve programming challenges to turn off the alarm, testing their skills in various programming languages.

🖥️ **Tech Stack:** 
Android Studio IDE (Java) + Firebase (Database)
